This is a personal project idea I had and I just wanted to create it very simple.
It will have false detection and it may not work perfeclty but im happy with the result and I will be doing improvements as I learn more about the language and libraries.


To start the program, create a virtual enviroment (recommended), install the packages and just run on terminal main.py, thats it, you can minimize it and leave it running!
